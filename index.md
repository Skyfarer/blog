# Cloud & Backend Consultant

I'm Jeremy, a cloud and backend consultant helping teams build reliable, scalable infrastructure.

## What I Do

**Cloud Architecture** — Design and implementation on AWS and IBM Cloud. Migrations, cost optimization, Kubernetes and Docker.

**Backend Development** — APIs, microservices, system design, and performance optimization. Linux expert and proficient in Ruby, Python, Go, C and Javascript/NodeJS.

I work with startups and established teams alike, whether you need hands-on implementation or strategic guidance.

When I'm not working, you'll find me flying my Mooney, hiking, or tinkering with microcontrollers. I also share my [photography](https://photography.skyfarer.cloud) and occasionally write about projects here on my [blog](/blog).
