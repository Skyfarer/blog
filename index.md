Hey I'm Jeremy! I'm a DevOps/Cloud engineer by trade, and dabble in several
nerdy hobbies:

- Aviation (Instrument Rated Private Pilot and own a Mooney M20M)
- [Photography](https://photography.skyfarer.cloud)
- Tinkering with arduino variants like the ESP8266
- Amateur Radio
- Brewing beer
- Backpacking in the back country

Several of these mix well too, so I'm often engaging in multiple hobbies at
once.

This site is where I share my [photography](https://photography.skyfarer.cloud) and rarely blog about these things.
