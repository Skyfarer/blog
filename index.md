# Cloud & Backend Consultant

I'm Jeremy, a cloud and backend consultant helping teams build reliable, scalable infrastructure.

## What I Do

**Cloud Architecture** — Design and implementation on AWS and IBM Cloud. Migrations, cost optimization, Kubernetes and Docker.

**Backend Development** — APIs, microservices, system design, and performance optimization. Linux expert and proficient in Ruby, Python, Go, C and Javascript/NodeJS.

I work with startups and established teams alike, whether you need hands-on implementation or strategic guidance.

## Where I've Been

**Backend Developer/Dev Ops Engineer** - For the last 17 years I've been with Verizon and HCLTech building and maintaining a cloud platform that supports the PMO. I've supported projects for American Express, Bank of America, Target, Starbucks, Johnson Controls, and Walgreens. 

Over the years I've helped multiple startups with successful exits.

When I'm not working, you'll find me flying my Mooney, hiking, or tinkering with microcontrollers. I also share my [photography](https://photography.skyfarer.cloud) and occasionally write about projects here on my [blog](/blog).
