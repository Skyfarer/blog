Hi! I'm Jeremy Walworth. I've been working for Verizon for about 13 years
as a devops engineer. 

This blog is about my favorite smells, which include: 

- The smell of a hot soldering iron: Raspberry Pi, Circuit Python compatible
  boards
- The smell of brewing beer: My gear consists of a Grainfather, Spike
  fermenter,
  and a few corny kegs.
- The smell of burning transistors: Callsign N4JSW, I like activating parks for POTA, FT8,
  JS8Call, WSPR, DMR. Current gear is Icom IC-7000, Xiegu G90, Btech DMR-6X2
- The smell of hot PLA: I use a Creality Ender 3 3D printer
- The smell of 100LL: I'm in a [club](https://tflyingclub.org/) where I fly a Cessna 182, 172, and Vans RV-12 
- The smell of compressed air: Favorite place to SCUBA is Bonaire! logged 3 trips there so far
- The smell of the forest: I like backpacking/hiking in the [Deam
  Wilderness](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hoosier/recarea/?recid=41554)
- The smell of bacon on a campfire: I have a Grand Design Imagine 2800BH that I tow with
  a Chevy Tahoe with the HD tow package
