title: About

I'm Jeremy Walworth. I've been working for Verizon for about 13 years
as a devops engineer. I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pi's, Arduinos,
and amateur radio.  I'm also a private pilot and member of a [local flying club](https://tflyingclub.org/). 
I fly the club's 182, 172, and RV-12.

This blog is where I plan to write about my (mis)adventures.
