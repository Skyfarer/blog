Here's the first pass, V0.01 of a cyberdeck for portable hacking. This one is powered
by a Raspberry Pi 5 and has an wide format screen. The 3D printed parts are
a bit flimsy so I'm doing some redesign for V0.2.

Having used the Pi3 and Pi4, the Pi5 is definitely large step up in performance. 
I added the Pimoroni NVMe hat and a 500GB NVMe SSD to this one. So there's plenty of 
fast storage. This is the first Pi that I've owned that could easily become my daily
driver.

The keyboard is attached with 3M Command Velcro.
