Here's the first pass, V0.01 of a cyberdeck for portable hacking. This one is powered
by a Raspberry Pi5 and has a wide format screen. The 3D printed parts are
a bit flimsy so I'm doing some redesign for V0.2.

Having used the Pi3 and Pi4, the Pi5 is definitely large step up in performance. 
I'm using the Pimoroni NVMe hat and a 500GB NVMe SSD for storage, and have
removed the SD card. 
This is the first version of Pi that I've owned that could easily replace my laptop for
portable ops. Firefox, Claude, and Docker all run quite smooth on it.

The keyboard is attached with 3M Command Velcro.
