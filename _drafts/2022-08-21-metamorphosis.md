This is the first of what hopefully will be a series of brain dump posts of my
journey from practicing Christianity to practicing Buddhism. 

I grew up going to a mix of Christian private schools, public schools, and
different churches. I've sat in all sorts of churches from mild Methodist to
weird and wild full gospel Pentecostal. My parents were Christians, and tried
very hard to raise my brother and me to be good Christian men.

The older I became, the more suspicious I became of what was being taught in
sermons, Bible study groups, my so called "accountability" partners. Every one
of them believed that the Bible is infallible, perfect, inspired by God Himself.
Yet, everyone had an interpretation of what it meant, and how it applied to me. 
The Bible is full of contradictions that are confusing, yet most just explain
these away with words that sound good and convincing, yet still leave the
issues unresolved.

Beyond the problems the Bible presents, the teachings of Jesus are of 
benevolence, compassion, empathy, and equanimity. All wonderful practices that
are valuable and useful to humanity.

I tried real hard to be the man of God I felt that I was called to be. But there 
was something that felt off about the whole charade. It wasn't until I took
a hard look at myself that it began to make sense. Thus began my
metamorphosis from Christian to Buddhist. 

In the posts that follow, I hope to articulate in small installments, how my
journey progressed, and how my thinking changed.
