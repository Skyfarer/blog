title: Cyberdeck\ Part\ 1

Recently I was poking around on the internet looking for cool Raspberry Pi
cases to 3D print. I have a few Raspberry Pi's around that do various tasks,
and I was thinking it would be cool to print up a stylish case. Well, this is
how I stumbled on the idea of building a cyberdeck.

I learned that the term "cyberdeck", comes from a cyberpunk book published in the 80's
called Neuromancer, by William Gibson. Once I started down the internet rabbit
hole of cyberdecks, I realized I needed to build one.

I have a RPi that I use with my Xiegu G90 HF transceiver, for digital
communication modes like FT8 and JS8Call. I decided straight away that my
cyberdeck would incorporate the Xiegu G90, and the RPi in a single, luggable
fashion.

So, I grabbed a Pelican case knock off from Harbor Freight, calipers, and fired
up TinkerCad.  Being a pilot, I really like the way panels in airliner cockpits appear
to be very modular. They look like they are mounted by screws on rails, sort of
like rack mounted equipment. I thought, this would be a neat way to design my
cyberdeck.

So here's what I started with:
