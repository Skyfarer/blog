I started [Bullet Journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/) last November, and
to my surprise it's really stuck!  I've tried lots of different organization
systems, and none have really resonated with my brain like this has. A few
years ago, I read "[Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)", and while I really
liked David Allen's organization ideas, I just couldn't get it to
implementation.  After reading Ryder Carroll's "The Bullet Journal Method",
I found myself visualizing the parts I loved about GTD implemented in my
own Bullet Journal. I can now say, after a few months, I am absolutely hooked.
I now have a journal that is always with me, and I'm feeling much less stress.
Before BuJo, I experienced anxiety and frustration over forgetting important
things. Now, when the thought enters my head, I write it in my daily journal page
and I can immediately get back to what I'm doing without losing my train of
thought.  It's wonderful!

So this brings me to the subject of this post. Here's a shot of my journal:

The Paperage journal I found on Amazon doesn't have a good place to hold a pen.
I can't just use any pen either. I have to use *my favorite pen*. Everyone has *their*
favorite model pen, right? Mine is the Papermate InkJoy gel 0.7. All other pens
are inferior. Fight me! ;-)

I can't journal without my favorite pen, so my pen needs to be with my journal,
all the time. But how to keep them together securely? I thought about designing
something in TinkerCad, but thought I'd check Thingiverse first. Well, I was
delightfully rewarded with [this simple yet brilliant design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1782329).
About 15 minutes later I had my pen clip printed and it works perfectly.
