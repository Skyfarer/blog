Recently I was poking around on the internet looking for cool Raspberry Pi
cases to 3D print. I have a few Raspberry Pi's around that do various tasks,
and I was thinking it would be cool to print up a stylish case. Well, this is
how I stumbled on the idea of building a cyberdeck.

I learned that the term "cyberdeck" comes from a cyberpunk book written in 1984
called Neuromancer, by William Gibson. Once I started down the internet rabbit
hole of cyberdecks, I realized I needed to build one. Checkout
[r/cyberdeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/) on Reddit to see some fun
and creative builds.

I have a RPi that I use with my Xiegu G90 HF transceiver, for digital
communication modes like FT8 and JS8Call. I decided straight away that my
cyberdeck would incorporate the Xiegu G90, and the RPi in a single, luggable
fashion. This would be perfect for [POTA](https://parksontheair.com/) activations or just general ham radio
geekery while RV camping.

So, I grabbed a Pelican case knock off from Harbor Freight, calipers, and fired
up TinkerCad.  Being a pilot, I really like the way panels in airliner cockpits appear
to be very modular. They look like they are mounted by screws on rails, sort of
like rack mounted equipment. I thought, this would be a neat way to design my
cyberdeck.

So here's what I started with:

I 3D printed some rails, like 19" rack rails. I started with round holes, but
then after more thinking, I decided to make the holes hexagons. This would
allow me to insert brass hexagon nuts anywhere I wanted a screw. I chose M3
sized hex nuts, and ordered an assortment case of M3 screws from Amazon.

Here's the parts seen in that photo:

  I love this keyboard, it's loud and clicky, reminds me of my dad's Kaypro 10
  in 1985

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Raspberry Pi 7" touch screen
- Harbor Freight equipment case
